- 👋 Hi, I’m Dominick Cortez.  
- 👀 I’m interested in blockchain technology and other innovative projects.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Solidity, and refreshing my full-stack development skills by building a portfolio that focuses on React, Angular, and .NET.  
- 💞️ I’m looking for an internship opportunity, paid or unpaid, to gain real-world experience.  I hope to also contribute to open source blockchain projects and contribute to the   space once I develop my skills.
