- 👋 Hi, I’m Dominick Cortez.  
- 👀 I’m interested in blockchain technology and other innovative projects.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Solidity, and refreshing my full stack development skills by building a portfolio that focuses on React, Angular, and .NET.  
- 💞️ I’m actively pursuing an internship opportunity, paid or unpaid, to gain valuable real-world experience.  Also, I hope to develop my blockchain technology skillset so I can     start contributing to open source projects.
